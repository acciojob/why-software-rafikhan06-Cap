	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I became a software developer because I love building useful things that solve real problems — whether it’s a clean website that helps a small agricultural business reach customers, an efficient tool that speeds up a brick-kiln workflow, or a tiny script that saves hours of manual work. Coding lets me combine creativity and logic: I enjoy planning a user-friendly design, then bringing it to life with code. I’m driven by the constant learning curve — every project introduces new tools, patterns, or techniques — and by the satisfaction of turning an idea into something people can actually use. Above all, I want to create reliable, maintainable software that empowers others, helps local businesses grow, and keeps improving with every iteration.</p>
